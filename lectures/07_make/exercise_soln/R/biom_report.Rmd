# Executive summary

```{r exec-summary-stats}
data_merge <- read.table("../clean_data/clean_data.txt", header = TRUE)
n <- nrow(data_merge)
n_female <- sum(data_merge$sexf)
mean_age <- good_round(mean(data_merge$age))
sd_age <- good_round(sd(data_merge$age))
```

There were `r n` observations successfully merged. There were `r n_female` females in the study and the average age was `r mean_age` (sd `r sd_age`).
